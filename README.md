## About Me

I started my journey in software engineering driven by a desire to build technology that makes a real impact — tools that solve problems, serve communities, and contribute to something greater than just code. I'm especially drawn to the intersection of social good and backend systems, and I’m excited about applying tech in ways that are thoughtful, ethical, and practical.

As a kinesthetic learner and INFJ, I thrive by engaging with challenges through hands-on exploration and reflective, big-picture thinking. My approach to tech is rooted in both curiosity and conviction — I care about building systems that are resilient, ethical, and human-focused.

I bring a strong foundation in leadership and operations from my previous work in the language and localization industry, where I led cross-functional teams, managed international projects, and built operational systems from the ground up. That background now shapes the way I build and collaborate in tech.

## Professional Background

Before transitioning into software engineering, I worked in project and operations management within the language and localization sector. I helped build a South African office from the ground up, led international client projects, managed remote teams, handled financial oversight, and acted as a bridge between stakeholders.

That experience taught me how to lead under pressure, work cross-functionally, and solve real problems with creativity and accountability — qualities I now bring into every tech project I work on.

## Get In Touch

I’m always open to connecting, collaborating, or simply sharing ideas. If you're working on something meaningful — or thinking about how tech can be more ethical, inclusive, and powerful — I'd love to hear from you.
